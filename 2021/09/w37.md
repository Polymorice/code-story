I have decided to take a couple of MOOC courses before I continue with the prep course from Launch School. From what I gathered, it seems that students with more fundamental knowledge could proceed faster in the curriculum. I was planning on supplement LS's core curriculum with these courses. Now it seems a better decision if I take them first before I dive into the curriculum.

previously I was following a tight schedule and a curriculum from the bootcamp. although I was not satisfied with the fast pace, the progress was steady. I have experimented free schedule in week 35 and vacation in 36. I can now conclude I could sleep whenever I want, but a learning task list or schedule is definitely necessary for making steady progress.

another experiment I am running is to adopt daily learning journal. basically taking note while learning anything, like a diary but just notes from everything I learn. I used to do it with hand written notes, but it takes a lot time. on top of that I really need to work on my typing speed. thus the learning journal is a perfect idea on paper.

so far it seems working, and I am getting back to the condition I was in for bootcamp, but more humanly possible.
