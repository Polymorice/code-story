now I have done the research on learning and productivity, the official foundational phase has begun. the focus of this phase is on computation theory basics, programming paradigms and design. along with the three mooc courses, I will pick up other youtube videos or webpages as additional sources. the expected outcome would be having a better understand how programming works, with less focus on syntax of various languages used in these courses. I might skip some of all of the practice at this moment, since I do expect to finish all of them somewhere in october.

another goal of this week is to summarize the research I did on learning skills and productivity last week, making it into a page or two worth of information, then memorize it and apply it for my study.
