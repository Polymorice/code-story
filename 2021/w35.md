open goals: finish JS100 and RS100 with both necessary and supplementary materials

I have finished the orientation course at LS, now moving on to the next course, where the path diverges into two branches, where I need to choose either JavaScript or Ruby track. My original goal was to focus on js, learn it really well, before I pick up Python and C again; since my ultimate goal is to transition from web dev to software dev. Before joining LS, I was studying js; but the quitting bootcamp and joining LS stopped my learning progress in js. Therefore I have decided to take JS100 first, to refamiliarize and build stronger foundation; however I do intend to go with the ruby track. I think it will expose me to a new language and a way of thinking. as a (at least) bilingual, I know the benefit of learning multiple distant or close related languages. the downside is this will significantly delay my goal of completing the LS curriculum and getting a job.

the journal entries are not edited at this moment. I used it as a semi personal journal and a way to organize my thoughts. if I had time, I would go back and edit them. if you are reading them now, and cringes for all of the syntactical errors. I apologize. ðŸ˜ƒ
