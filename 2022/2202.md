realizing that I was not using the paid materials from Launch School, and found other books and lectures instead. I put a pause on my subscription plan. after given some thoughts. I think maybe my original plan was indeed a good plan, but at the same time last year, when I was just starting the journey on learning programming, I knew nothing and felt lost, hence I was not making much progress and abandoned it. I now know that I might quit and resume multiple times, which I have done, but the more I learn, the more I like it. I can finally see the benefits of learning coding. the original plan is use books and lectures available, and learn from them, build a solid foundation with a handful of languages, then work on data structures and algorithms. eventually, work on as many coding problems as I can and make projects along the way. for now, I think I will stick to that plan. I may resume Launch School courses in the future, but now, I would rather stick to books and lectures.
