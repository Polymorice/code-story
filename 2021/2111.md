this is written in retrospective. the self-learning was taking a pause, once again. I read in many Reddit posts and heard it in many programmers' stories. they all have abandoned the learning multiple times before finally making it happen, but I was seriously considering abandoning this once and for all. programming was not where my passion is. I know I wanted to be in biological and medical sciences. I also know I can thrive in school. On the other hand, I am a fast learner and a hard worker. I might not have great grades, but every place I have ever worked, I do my job well. at this moment I am not treat programming as school nor paid work. to be honest, I was not so sure learning was for me. therefore, I had abandoned the plan and taken a break, to think.
