### WEEK 34

initially written on 2021/08/22

TL;DR:

- quitting bootcamp in week 1, beginning Launch School's curriculum
- developed study habit: work from late night to morning, turn off all notifications

in January 2021, I had suddenly decided to drop all of my winter courses on math and classics, to embark on a serious journey to learning coding and eventually becoming a programmer one day. during the initial honeymoon phase, I managed to finish watching all videos in [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo), [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382_R182iC2gNZI9HzWFMC_8) and [Python for Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI). I didn't do any actual coding, instead I let the theory sink in. Soon I realized that I have no idea how to actually get to my goal of becoming a software developer. I know web development is easier to get in, and I plan to start from there, and eventually learn more languages and theories, then transition to a software developer. Not too long after, the passion evaporated, I was drawn to WoW; hence began a couple months of full time gaming. Best thing happened since the pandemic.

in june, I had to choose to either start job hunting again, which means to do the same dead end jobs or take learning coding more seriously. Thankfully, I was able to receive the tuition from the family. with some research I have settle on applying for [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) which seems to be the best option for coding bootcamp in Canada.

after passing the interview, I was required to complete a lengthy prep work, which was the first real coding experience I had ever since I decided to study programming. the materials are a combination of practical programmer tools and JavaScript. I had so much trouble from installing vagrant, using git in terminal, to actual coding questions; but I did not turn to the forum. endless googling and trying actually made me fall in love with programming. I love the challenges, and solving problems on my own. it clicks with my obsessive personality.

I naively believed that the next three months is just the extension of the happy coding experience. on the first day, I finished all of the mandatory work not including the extra questions, at 6AM the next morning. I realized that this is nothing like what I was doing. not only I cannot go deeper for learning and trouble shooting, but also I began to see that it is impossible to cover all of the job-ready knowledge in three months. I know I want to quit, but I don't know what is my option. thank to the bootcamp prep work, I have finally gained the habit and momentum for learning programming. I know now that I can learn it on my own, that I do not need a strick training institute. on top of that, I prefer study on my own and I do most of my study from 12AM to 10AM. I was going to supplement bootcamp with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). I have noticed that both Lighthouse Labs and The Odin Project use materials from an organization called [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). I had no idea what that is, but after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR7zLisSpFc) and reading some posts on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) I totally agree with their teaching philosophy.

so here I am, quit something again, but this time, I lost 25% of the tuition, which is a big deal to me. on the other hand, I could not be happier that I have found something better.

over the weekend, I have done half of the orientation materials, which consists a lot of readings, including _George Leonard's Mastery_. it recommend the students to take [Learn How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). I surely will go through that course as well.

I was joking to my partner, saying that I feel like Launch School is like a cult, with all the brain washing articles require the students to read. yet with each readings I complete, I felt that I have chosen the right path for becoming a software developer, i. e. mastery!
