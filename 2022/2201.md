> Launch School registration

I changed the journal format to monthly basis. I regroup the previous entries by month. in the future, each month gets its own entry, but the content might be updated multiple times as I see fit.

the priority is to start Launch School paid courses as soon as possible. if in any case it would not work out, I might look into enrolling into local college for programming program. I think these are two of my best options. personally I prefer Launch School, since it's more flexible. we will see how it goes, then I will decide to do it full time or take on some part time shifts.

### WEEK 05

#### goal:

> Ruby Zach

> Ruby Jason

> Ruby Lei

#### done:

> Ruby Zach

soon after I started the paid course, I discovered a couple of video series on Ruby in Chinese. I found them well-made and informative, tailored for intermediate to advanced learners. Thus I have decided to put a pause on the paid courses, instead, I will finish these courses first.
