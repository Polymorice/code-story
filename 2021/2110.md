I find the Stanford cs106 is quite suitable for my needs at this moment. each lecture provides challenging examples, and introduces new ideas and concepts gradually. so the current goal is to finish this series first.

done: CS106A - Programming Methodology

finally finished 106A, now started working on 106X. I quite like the instructor's teaching style and the content organization, but C++ is not the easiest language to learn, even after learning Java right before jumping into C. I am going to take a detour to watch some crash course videos on C and all of the languages I intend to learn, before diving into C and programming paradigms.
