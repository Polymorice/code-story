The most of this week was spent on vacationing at cottage and sleeping to regain the function of my body, since I cannot sleep at any place other than my bed or couch.

### WEEK 37

initially written on 2021/09/12

#### open goals:

> Learn like a Pro, Oakley and Schewe

> [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program)

> [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2021a/home)

> [Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

#### done:

I have decided to take a couple of MOOC courses before I continue with the prep course from Launch School. From what I gathered, it seems that students with more fundamental knowledge could proceed faster in the curriculum. I was planning on supplement LS's core curriculum with these courses. Now it seems a better decision if I take them first before I dive into the curriculum.

previously I was following a tight schedule and a curriculum from the bootcamp. although I was not satisfied with the fast pace, the progress was steady. I have experimented free schedule in week 35 and vacation in 36. I can now conclude I could sleep whenever I want, but a learning task list or schedule is definitely necessary for making steady progress.

another experiment I am running is to adopt daily learning journal. basically taking note while learning anything, like a diary but just notes from everything I learn. I used to do it with hand written notes, but it takes a lot time. on top of that I really need to work on my typing speed. thus the learning journal is a perfect idea on paper.

so far it seems working, and I am getting back to the condition I was in for bootcamp, but more humanly possible.

the learning journal is quite useful. I will continue using for all learning tasks. I have read learn like a pro once, but for a dense book like that, I will read it a couple more time and take learn the techniques well, before I continue with other mooc courses.

### WEEK 39

initially written on 2021/09/26

#### open goals:

> #STDUY summary sheet

> CS106A - Programming Methodology

> CS106B - Programming Abstraction

> CS107 - Programming Paradigms

> [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program)

> [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2021a/home)

> [Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

#### done:

now I have done the research on learning and productivity, the official foundational phase has begun. the focus of this phase is on computation theory basics, programming paradigms and design. along with the three mooc courses, I will pick up other youtube videos or webpages as additional sources. the expected outcome would be having a better understand how programming works, with less focus on syntax of various languages used in these courses. I might skip some of all of the practice at this moment, since I do expect to finish all of them somewhere in october.

another goal of this week is to summarize the research I did on learning skills and productivity last week, making it into a page or two worth of information, then memorize it and apply it for my study.
