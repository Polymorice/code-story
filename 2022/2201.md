### WEEK 01

initially written on 2021/12/30

goal:

finish RB100

Launch School registration

done:

I changed the journal format to monthly basis. I regroup the previous entries by month. in the future, each month gets its own entry, but the content might be updated multiple times as I see fit.

the priority is to start Launch School paid courses as soon as possible. if in any case it would not work out, I might look into enrolling into local college for programming program. I think these are two of my best options. personally I prefer Launch School, since it's more flexible. we will see how it goes, then I will decide to do it full time or take on some part time shifts.
